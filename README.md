# electric-nose
Server and client code for the Electric Nose Project
This repository contains the backend and fronted code for my Masters university project. It uses NodeJs for the backend and bootstrap framework for the frontend. 
MongoDB is used for the database. Graphs are plotted using chart.js library.
The server code was tested on a raspberry pi 4. The raspberry PI served the weather sensors data stored in the database through a REST-like API. This API is 
then used in the front-end code and rendered in the browser.
